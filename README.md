# mautrix-discord (Modified Fork)
This is a modified fork of [mautrix-discord](https://github.com/mautrix/discord) based on [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

## Changes in This Fork

This fork disables **direct media for avatars only** even if the config.yaml has direct_media enabled.

### Reason

Some Synapse homeserver configurations reject remote `mxc://` avatar media
if it is not already present in the local media repository cache. Disabling
direct media for avatars only ensures that mautrix-discord defaults to 
copying the attachment to the main matrix homeserver.

No other direct media functionality has been modified.

#### NOTE:
This patch is intentionally minimal. As this is not my primary programming
language, I opted for a small modification rather than introducing new
configuration structures. Ideally, a configurable option under brige.direct_media 
for the config.yaml for specifically enabling or disabling avatars independently would be 
a nicer solution as to ensure compatibility with matrix servers other than Synapse.
